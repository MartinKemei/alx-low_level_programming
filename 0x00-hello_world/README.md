# 0x00. C - Hello, World

## gcc and other compilers
- preprocessing
```
ignores comments, replaces preprocessor directives (#) expands macros and header files

```
- compiling
```
the output passed on from the preprocessor is then used to generate machine code
or assembly code with a .s extension

```
- assembly
```
the assembly code is then converted to object code (similar to binary code)
with the .o extension  

```
- linking
```
the final stage where all the object/machine code is linked to 
an executable file a.out or .exe in Windows

```

## writing simple C programs
- using `printf, putchar` and `puts`
- understanding the `main` - a primary function for every 
C program that serves as a starting point for program execution 

## Betty Linter
- C code checker written in _perl_ inspired by the Linux Kernel coding style
