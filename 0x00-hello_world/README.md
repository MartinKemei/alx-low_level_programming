# 0x00. C - Hello, World
*C* is a procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie and mostly popularized 
by the effort of Dennis Ritchie and Prof Brian Kernighan while writing the book _C_. 
It was mainly developed to write operating systems.

## Why learn C in the first place?
In my opinion the single most important reason for learning C is it helps you understand
the inner workings and architecture of how computer systems work. Aspects like memory management
and allocation along with the overall concepts that drive programming.

## Major uses of C
- Developing compliers
- Developing Operating Systems
