## What is debugging?
The process of finding and fixing errors in software and web apps. The errors are what are reffered to as _bugs_ by software developers. The words _'bug'_ and _'debugging'_ were coined by __Admiral Grace Hoper__ who wrote the first compiler that ever existed.

## Manual methods of debugging
Manual debugging refers to the process of identifying and fixing issues in code by analyzing its behavior, without relying on automated debugging tools. Here are some common methods for manual debugging:

- **Print Statements:** Inserting print statements at various points in the code can help you track the flow of execution and the values of variables. Print statements allow you to observe the intermediate states of your program and identify any unexpected behavior or incorrect values.

- **Code Review:** Review your code line by line, paying close attention to the logic and variable assignments. Look for any potential mistakes, typos, or incorrect assumptions. A fresh perspective and careful scrutiny can often reveal errors that may have been overlooked.

- **Divide and Conquer:** If you have a large codebase, try narrowing down the issue by systematically disabling or isolating sections of the code. By selectively commenting out parts of the code, you can identify the specific section where the problem occurs and focus your debugging efforts there.

- **Trace Execution:** Mentally trace the execution of the code, following the control flow and variable values. Pay attention to conditional statements, loops, and function calls. Verify that the program executes as intended and that variables hold the expected values.

- **Input Validation:** Check if the input values are valid and within the expected range. Validate user input and ensure that it matches the expected data type. Incorrect or unexpected input can lead to program errors, so validating inputs is an important debugging step.

- **Code Isolation:** If possible, try to isolate the problematic code by creating a minimal, self-contained example that reproduces the issue. By reducing the code to its core elements, you can focus on the specific problem without being distracted by unrelated parts.

- **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explain your code and the problem you're facing to an inanimate object like a rubber duck. By verbalizing the problem, you might gain new insights and find a solution. This technique helps to clarify your thoughts and forces you to approach the problem from a different perspective.

- **Manual Testing:** Test different scenarios and inputs manually to observe the behavior of your code. Try to identify specific inputs or conditions that trigger the issue. This process can help you narrow down the problem and understand its underlying causes.

- **Code Inspection:** Thoroughly review your code, paying attention to variables, loops, conditional statements, and function calls. Look for potential logical errors, missing or incorrect conditions, and inconsistent variable states.

- **Debugging by Hypothesis:** Formulate hypotheses about the cause of the issue based on your understanding of the code and its behavior. Test each hypothesis systematically to verify or refute it. This approach can help you narrow down the potential causes and guide your debugging efforts.

Remember, manual debugging can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for complex issues. Using an integrated development environment (IDE) with built-in debugging tools or specialized debuggers can significantly simplify the debugging process.

## GCC flags and their use in debugging
GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a popular compiler suite used for compiling programs written in languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. It provides various command-line options, also known as flags, to control the behavior of the compiler. Here are some commonly used GCC flags:

- **-o** <output>: Specifies the name of the output file generated by the compiler. For example, -o program will produce an executable file named "program".

- **-c:** Compiles the source file(s) without linking, generating object file(s) instead. This flag is useful when you want to compile code separately and then link it later.

- **-g:** Includes debugging information in the compiled program. This flag allows you to use debugging tools to analyze and debug your code effectively.

- **-Wall:** Enables a set of warning messages about potentially problematic code constructs. It's recommended to use this flag to catch potential issues and improve code quality.

- **-Werror:** Treats warnings as errors, causing the compiler to halt if any warnings are encountered. This flag helps enforce strict code quality standards.

- **-std=<standard>:** Sets the language standard to be used for compilation. For example, -std=c11 sets the C11 standard, -std=c++17 sets the C++17 standard, etc.

- **-I<directory>:** Specifies additional directories to search for header files. Use this flag when your source files include headers located in non-standard locations.

- **-L<directory>:** Adds directories to the library search path. This flag allows the linker to find libraries located in non-standard locations.

- **-l<library>:** Links the program with the specified library during the linking phase. For example, -lm links with the math library.

- **-O<level>:** Enables compiler optimizations. The <level> can be a value from 0 to 3, where higher levels provide more aggressive optimizations. For example, -O2 enables moderate optimization.

These are just a few examples of commonly used GCC flags. The GCC documentation provides a comprehensive list of available flags along with detailed descriptions of their usage. You can access the documentation online or by using the command man gcc in a terminal to view the manual pages.
  
  ## How to read error messages
  Reading and interpreting error messages is an essential skill in debugging code. Error messages provide valuable information about the issue at hand and can guide you towards finding a solution. Here are some steps to effectively read and understand error messages:

- Read the error message: Start by carefully reading the error message from beginning to end. Pay attention to the specific error or warning indicated and any associated error codes or line numbers.

- Identify the error type: Determine the general category or type of error indicated by the message. Common error types include syntax errors, runtime errors, linker errors, and logical errors. Understanding the type of error can help you narrow down the possible causes.

- Analyze the error message contents: Look for specific details within the error message that can provide clues about the problem. This may include variable names, function calls, file names, or error codes. These details can help you pinpoint the location or cause of the issue.

- Check the line number or location: If the error message includes a line number or a reference to a specific location in the code, navigate to that location and review the code around it. Often, the error is caused by a mistake or inconsistency in that area.

- Understand the error description: Error messages usually include a description that explains the nature of the problem. Try to comprehend the description and its implications. Look for keywords or phrases that indicate the source of the error, such as "undefined variable," "mismatched types," or "division by zero."

- Search for the error message: Copy the error message, including any relevant error codes or keywords, and search for it online. Many programming languages and frameworks have extensive documentation and community forums where others may have encountered similar issues. Searching for the error can lead you to discussions or solutions that can help resolve the problem.

- Consider the context: Evaluate the context in which the error occurs. Consider the inputs, variables, and conditions that may be relevant to the problem. Sometimes, errors are triggered by specific scenarios or corner cases that may not be immediately obvious.

- Review recent changes: If the error occurs after making recent modifications to the code, review those changes carefully. Focus on the areas that were modified and consider the implications of the changes. It's possible that an introduced bug or unintended side effect is causing the error.

- Break down the error: Break down the error message into its components and try to identify the key elements that can help in troubleshooting. Look for keywords, file names, variable names, and specific error codes. Analyzing these elements can provide valuable insights into the root cause.

- Consult documentation and resources: Consult the documentation or resources specific to the programming language, framework, or tools you are using. Check the official documentation, community forums, or Stack Overflow for explanations and solutions related to the error. These resources often provide detailed explanations and workarounds for common issues.

Remember that error messages are meant to guide you towards the problem, but they may not always be self-explanatory. Debugging often involves a process of trial and error, where you analyze the error message, make adjustments to the code, and observe the effects. Be patient, persistent, and systematic in your debugging efforts.
