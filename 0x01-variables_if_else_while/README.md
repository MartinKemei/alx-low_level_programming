# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Variables
A variable is a container _(storage area)_ with a unique name _(identifier)_
that holds data
which can be manipulated by a program.
A variable's name can include letters, numbers, and the underscore character.
Either a letter or an underscore must come first. Because C is case-sensitive,
uppercase and lowercase characters are separate.

## Commonly used data types

| Type | Size (bytes) | Format Specifier |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| int | 2 OR 4 | %d %i|
| char | 1 | %c |
| float | 4 | %f |
| double | 8 | %lf |
| unsigned int | 2 OR 4 | %u |
| long double | at least 10 usually 12 OR 16 | %LF |

## C keywords 
`auto` `double` `int` `struct` `break` `else` `long` `switch` `case` `enum` `register` `typedef` `char` `extern` `return` `union` `continue` `for` `signed` `void` `do` `if` `static` `while` `default` `goto` `sizeof` `volatile` `const` `float` `short` `unsigned`

## C if ... else statements
### The *if* Statement
the `if` statement is used to specify a block  of code to be executed if a `condition` is `true.`
> Syntax
```
if (condition) {
// block of code to be executed if condtion is true
}
```
### The *else* Statement
the `else` statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed if the `condition` is `false.`
> Syntax
```
if (condition) {
// block of code to be executed if the statement is true
} else {
// block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```
### The *else if* Statement
the `else` `if` statement is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is `false`
> Syntax
```
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```
# Loops

![loops](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/CS121/ClassTopics/Images/Loops01.jpg 'loops')

## C `while` and `do ... while` loop
### The `while loop`
In C programming language, the `while` Loop is an entry-controlled loop. When the specified condition is still true, this loop may be used to iterate the block of codeÂ code.
> Syntax
```
while (test expression) {
// body of the loop
}
```
### The `do ... while` loop
!['do ... while loop'](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/CS121/ClassTopics/Images/Loops06.jpg 'do while loop')

There is one significant distinction between the `while` loop and the `do..while` loop. The `do...while` loop's body is run at least once. The test expression is only evaluated after that.
> Syntax
```
do {
// body of the loop
}
while (test expression);
```
