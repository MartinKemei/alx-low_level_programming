# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Variables
A variable is a container _(storage area)_ with a unique name _(identifier)_
that holds data
which can be manipulated by a program.
A variable's name can include letters, numbers, and the underscore character.
Either a letter or an underscore must come first. Because C is case-sensitive,
uppercase and lowercase characters are separate.
### Basic variable types;
```
char: 1 byte
int: 4 byte(s)
float: 4 byte(s)
double: 8 byte(s)
```
